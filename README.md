## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. SMS Scanning
- Uses a `BroadcastReceiver` (`SmsReceiver`) to listen for incoming banking messages.
- A background `SmsScanner` service can be triggered to scan existing inbox messages.
- Uses regex patterns to extract Amount, Bank Name, Account Number, and Transaction Type.

### 2. Transaction Management
- Transactions are stored locally in a Room database.
- The **Passbook** screen shows recent SMS-detected transactions for review.
- The **Home** screen displays finalized monthly transactions with daily totals.

### 3. File Import
- Supports importing financial data from multiple formats:
  - **CSV/TXT**: Comma-separated or tab-separated text files.
  - **Excel (XLS/XLSX)**: Direct parsing of spreadsheet files using Apache POI.
- Features an **Import Preview** screen to review data before it's added to your records.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Ladybug or later.
- Java 17+.
- Android device running Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Allow Gradle to sync and download dependencies (including Apache POI for Excel support).
3. Connect your Android device and click **Run**.
4. Grant **SMS Permissions** when prompted on the first launch.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

WalletFlow is built with privacy as a core principle:
- **Offline First**: The app does **not** have internet permissions. Your data never leaves your device.
- **Minimal Permissions**: We only request SMS permissions to read transaction alerts. No phone state or location access is required.
- **No Ads/Tracking**: No analytics or advertising SDKs are included.
